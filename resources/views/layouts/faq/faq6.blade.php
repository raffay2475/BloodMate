        <p>Yes, but if it was recent you may need to wait for a bit. It depends what you got, where and when.   

            Tattoos: You can donate plasma (and show off your new ink!) straight away after a tattoo, as long as it was done in a licensed tattoo parlour in Australia. But, you’ll need to wait one week to give blood or platelets, no matter how big or small the tattoo is — that means cosmetic tattoos, too. If the tattoo wasn’t done in a licensed tattoo parlour in Australia, you’ll need to wait four months before donating.
            Ear piercing: You can only donate plasma for the first 24 hours after having it done. After that, you can donate blood or platelets too.  
            Body piercing: You can only donate plasma for the next 4 months after having it done. After that, you’re good to give blood or platelets.  
            Whether it’s your ear or anywhere else, the piercing should be done with clean, single-use equipment. If it wasn’t or you aren’t sure, you’ll need to wait at least four months before you can donate anything.
